        Like any other sophomore, I was browsing YouTube hoping to find something interesting during my never-ending free time. That’s when I came across this video (kudos to YouTube’s algorithm) that had the title ‘internships or not’. Initially, I thought it was some lame marketing strategy that promotes stuff about paid internships. I still went ahead and clicked on the thumbnail, because obviously, I had a lot of free time. That was the video that changed a lot in my life. I liked the way he expressed his interest towards the growth of a students’ careers. I started watching more and more videos from his channel and that’s when I knew about roc8 and Neogcamp. Its quite amazing how hard they work to make sure everyone who comes to them with the required prerequisites lands a well-paid job. Even colleges aren’t that dedicated during campus placements. I always had an interest for web development, for it gives the person the satisfaction one needs every time one makes some progress. Neogcamp was an opportunity I never asked for. I watched the first video in the playlist and in the very first few minutes, I decided I will go try this level 0 at any cost. The level 0 was such an eye opener for everyone who are new to web development. The syllabus is neatly laid out, no misunderstandings whatsoever and the icing on the cake is their discord server, where more than 1000 web developer are available 24/7 to clarify every single doubt of yours, whether or not they’re related to Neogcamp. Never came across another discord server that serves a better purpose. Kudos to their whole team for doing whatever they’re doing and hope they keep continuing it. This was it. This is where I have learnt basic JavaScript and enough HTML and CSS to create the portfolio you are viewing right now. Thanks to Tanay and <a href="https://neog.camp/" class="link" target="_blank">Neogcamp</a> for this opportunity.
